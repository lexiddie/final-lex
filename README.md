# Getting Started with Create React App

There are several libraries were used in this project. First, since it was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)., it primary core of this project is using React. And, be advised React is not a framework, it is a library. Second, node-sass library is very important in this project to due to; it is leveraging SASS instead of CSS. Moreover, SASS is way more advance and nested style in style this web app. Third, the state management of this project is [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), it might be too overkill to use the Redux library in this small project however it is a good practice with enterprise standard. Fourth, [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is the very service from Google to store database, storage, and Host web app. This project cannot be done without leveraging Firebase, it has free tier in which developers would not need to pay. However, if the requirement must use Cloud Functions, the pay as you go is a must.
